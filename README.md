# Power Meter with mqtt-for devices with pulse output


## About

 This project presents a simple solution for measuring the energy consumption of a house. The key element is a cheap energy monitor with pulse output, connected to an [ESP32 WROOM 32 board](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/hw-reference/modules-and-boards.html#esp-modules-and-boards-esp32-wroom-32). This, over WiFi using mqtt protocol can be easily connected to a home automation system to report:
- instant power (in Watt);
- total power consumption (in kWh);
- Device temperature (in Celsius) using a DS18b20 temperature sensor.

OTA support is enabled, after the first software upload, the ESP will available for updates on the local network over [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software).

## Hardware Components

### ESP 32 board
[ESP32 WROOM 32 board](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/hw-reference/modules-and-boards.html#esp-modules-and-boards-esp32-wroom-32)

### The Power Meter

The power meter [adeleq_02-553_DIG](https://www.dedeman.ro/ro/contor-monofazic-digital-45a-1m-02-553/dig/p/1030357) operating range is 0.05A-45A, and (the most important part) provide 2000 impulses / kWh. Emitted pulses for detections have ~90 ms pulse width. The output is open collector, operating voltage, from 5-24V. In this case, the ESP32 supply provides 3.3V, but this is not a limitation. Other variants are available on the market, usually, the difference is the accuracy (i.e. pulses / kWh are only 1000 instead of 2000).

</h1>
Below a sample picture for the output, where a light bulb (~53W) is connected to the power meter.
The measured pulse between the two detections is about 30.71s, which leads to a value measured of ~58.61 Watts.

```
Conversion from kWh to Watts, measured with a sensor of 2000 pulses/ kWh:
(<kilo Watt to Watt>*<Hour in secounds>/<impuse number>)/<time measured between pulses> 
=>(1000*3600/2000)/31.71 => 58.71W
```

### The temperature sensor
[DS18b20](https://datasheets.maximintegrated.com/en/ds/DS18B20.pdf) is a fast digital thermometer using 1-Wire protocol. The usual connection diagram is with a 4.7 kOhm pull-up resistor.

### Connection diagramm

Below the wiring diagram, made with [Easyeda](https://easyeda.com/) tool. In noisy environments, the recommendation is to add a 33pf condensator between ground and energy sensor input pins (to avoid sporadic interrupts).

# How to use

Clone the repository, update the .ino file in [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) with your local WiFi / mqtt configuration.

>Note: you need to install the following libraries before compile: [PubSubClient](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/pubsubclient/) - for mqtt client, [OneWire](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/onewire/) - for 1-wire communication and [DallasTemerature](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/dallastemperature/) - for DS18b20 temperature sensor.

>Note: to enable serial debugging, uncomment the following line: #define DEBUG

>Note: once flashed the the ESP32, after a succesfull connect to your WiFi, OTA update become available. This means the device can be mounted and the software can be flashed / updated over the your local network (see the new port under ArduinoIDE->tools->port->network ports).

```
/*mqtt declarations*/
const char* mqtt_server = "<IP OF THE MQTT SERVER>";
const char* mqtt_user = "<USER NAME>";
const char* mqtt_password = "<PASSWORD>";
...
/* SSID and Password of WiFi router */
const char* ssid = "<ROUTER SSID>";
const char* password = "<ROUTER PASSWORD>";
```

Upload the code in the [ESP32 WROOM 32 board](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/hw-reference/modules-and-boards.html#esp-modules-and-boards-esp32-wroom-32) over USB, wire the board accordingly to the schematics. The output will be something similar on the mqtt topics:
<h1 align="center">
<a name="Pulse Output" href=""><img src="images/mqtt.png" alt="400" width="400"></a>
</h1>

~~~
Additionally the following mqtt commands can be used:
- topic: /pulseenergymonitor/cmd
- payload: c / r
  c - clear kWh information
  r - reset the device
~~~

## Home Assistant integration

[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is an open source automatization system, with a high number of component integratios. Is a good choise for complex IOT and DIY smart home atomatization. Below a panel component and a log file which shows the sensor information and energy consumption.

<a name="Pulse Output" href=""><img src="images/hass.png" alt="400" width="400"></a>
</h1>

Paste the following lines in the configuration.yaml file:
```
sensor:
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "/pulseenergymonitor/watts"
    name: "Pulse Energy Monitor"
    icon: mdi:gauge
    unit_of_measurement: "W"
  - platform: mqtt
    state_topic: "/pulseenergymonitor/kWh"
    name: "PEM kWh"
    icon: mdi:gauge
    unit_of_measurement: "kWh"
```
Energy consumption measurement has a specific component in Home Assistant, the [utility meter](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/utility_meter/), past into configuration.yaml file.
